    <h3><a name="prereq">Prerequisites:</a></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            MicroSD card (min 2 GB, SDXC is NOT supported) 2 GB card will be sufficient.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bluetooth dongle. Tested with a cheap non-branded one, like
            <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bluetooth-USB-Micro-Adapter-Dongle/dp/B004C48L60/ref=sr_1_4?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1436962512&sr=1-4&keywords=bluetooth+dongle">this</a>.

        <!--<li>-->
        <!--Linux system is assumed, although the guide should be relevant for Mac OS X users (Windows users should-->
        <!--check this out <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Windows%20Installation/">http://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Windows%20Installation/</a>).-->
        <!--</li>-->
        <li>
            I recommend to use Oracle JDK over Open JDK. <span class="name">lejos-server</span> was developed with
            Oracle Java 7.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="step-1">Step 1: download leJOS</a></h3>

    <p>
        If you're using Linux (or Mac OS X), then download a file named <span
            class="code">leJOS_EV3_0.9.0-beta.tar.gz</span> from the
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lejos/files/lejos-EV3/0.9.0-beta/">leJOS EV3 download page</a> and
        unpack it (the guide assumes you will unpack it to your home directory). If you are feeling adventurous you may
        try a newer version if there is one, but be prepared for
        compatibility issues.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="step-2">Step 2: prepare the memory card</a></h3>

    <p>
        To install leJOS you will need a blank SD card of at least 2GB and no more than 32GB. SDXC cards are not
        supported by the EV3 hardware. The card needs to be formatted with a FAT32 partition. On Linux this can be done
        using <a href="http://gparted.org/">GParted</a>, on Windows you may use
        <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/">SD Formatter 4.0</a>, but there are many alternatives.
        Even if the card is new it is worth using this program as SD cards sometimes have hidden partitions on them
        which can cause problems with the EV3.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="step-3">Step 3: install leJOS on the brick</a></h3>

    <p>
        In the <span class="code">leJOS_EV3_0.9.0-beta</span> directory you will find
        <span class="code">lejosimage.zip</span> file. Extract its contents to the root directory of the card.<br>
        Next you need to download Oracle Java JRE and place it on the card. Suitable JRE can be found at
        <a href="http://java.com/legomindstorms">http://java.com/legomindstorms</a>. You should download "Oracle Java SE
        Embedded version 7 Update 60" (file
        <span class="code">ejre-7u60-fcs-b19-linux-arm-sflt-headless-07_may_2014.tar.gz</span>). It is free, but you
        will need to accept the licence agreement and create a free Oracle account, if you do not have one.<br>
        Place this file into the root directory of the card. The contents of the card should be:
        <img src="contents_of_the card.png"/>
    </p>

    <p>
        When you have written these files to the card, <i>safely</i> remove it, put it in the EV3 and boot the EV3.
        leJOS will then reformat your card to have a 500MB FAT32 partition and a Linux ext2 partition using the rest of
        the card. It will prepare the card for use by leJOS showing you its progress as it goes. This process takes
        about 8 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
        This will not affect the original firmware/software of the EV3 brick. With the memory card removed it will just
        have stock software.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="step-4">Step 4: connect to EV3 via Bluetooth</a></h3>

    <p>
        It is possible to connect to the brick via Bluetooth, WiFi, or USB cable. In each case a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_area_network">PAN</a> network is setup which allows TCP
        communication between your machine and EV3. This guide explains how to connect via Bluetooth as it's more energy
        efficient method and does not require a special WiFi dongle. If you wish to connect by other means you can
        follow these guides: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Configuring%20Wifi/">WiFi</a>,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SAaQq8omeQ">USB</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Connecting on DICE</h4>

    <p>
        DICE machines should be prepared for EV3 connection. Plug in the Bluetooth dongle provided. The MAC address
        should be written/attached to the brick. If it's not there, <a href="#mac">refer to Linux guide</a> on how to
        obtain it. To connect issue these commands (with a pause in between):<br/>
        <span class="code">ev3pand 00:16:53:46:63:B6<br/>ev3conf 10.0.1.2</span><br/>
        Where <span class="code">00:16:53:46:63:B6</span> is your brick's MAC address. The second command assigns IP
        <span class="code">10.0.1.2</span> to your computer on bluetooth interface so you can choose it freely. Default
        IP of the brick is <span class="code">10.0.1.1</span><br/>
        Try to ping the brick to make sure it's connected <span class="code">ping -c3 10.0.1.1</span>
    </p>

    <h4>Windows</h4>

    <p>
        Connecting on Windows is quite straightforward, but it's a little different on different versions. Make sure
        your computer has bluetooth on. On Windows 8.1:<br/>
        Go to "Control Panel", find "Devices and Printers" and enter. Click "Add a device". It should look like this:
        <br/>
        <img src="windows_screenshots/1.png"/><br/>
        When "EV3" is found click on it and "next". It will prompt you with a code, asking if you can see it on the EV3.
        However, this feature is not currently supported by leJOS, so you won't see the code. If you confirm that you
        see it, the device should be installed:<br/>
        <img src="windows_screenshots/2.png"/><br/>
        And it should appear in the list of "Devices and Printers". Right-click it, and connect:<br/>
        <img src="windows_screenshots/3.png"/><br/>
        You can ping the brick just like in Linux, to see if it's actually connected.
    </p>


    <h4>Linux</h4>

    <p>
        There are two tools that you need: <span class="code">pand</span> binary (available in Bluez compatibility
        package <span class="code">bluez-compat</span>). On Ubuntu can be installed with command <span class="code">sudo apt-get install bluez-compat</span>.
        Additionally, your system must have either <span class="code">ifconfig</span> or <span class="code">ip</span>
        tools available. Bluetooth is built-in in most modern laptops, if your computer doesn't have it, you need a
        Bluetooth dongle.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then to connect to your EV3 brick, you need to get its MAC address. Make sure that Bluetooth visibility is
        turned on on the brick. To get the MAC address run command:<br/>
        <span class="code">hcitool scan</span><br/>
        The response should look like:<br/>
        <span class="code">Scanning ...<br/>
        00:16:53:46:63:B6 EV3</span><br/>
        Here <span class="code">00:16:53:46:63:B6</span> is the MAC address.<br/>
        Error: <span class="code">Device is not available: No such device</span> usually means that you bluetooth dongle
        is not connected.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a name="mac">Now</a> you can connect to the brick:
        <span class="code">sudo pand --connect 00:16:53:46:63:B6</span> where
        <span class="code">00:16:53:46:63:B6</span> is the MAC address of the brick. This command won't print anything.
        <br/>
        After a pause issue<br/>
        <span class="code">sudo ifconfig bnep0 10.0.1.2</span><br/>
        OR<br/>
        <span class="code">sudo ip address add 10.0.1.2 dev bnep0</span>
        <br/><br/>
        This command assigns an IP address <span class="code">10.0.1.2</span> to your PC on
        <span class="code">bnep0</span> bluetooth network interface (by default the brick should have address
        <span class="code">10.0.1.1</span>).<br/>
        To check if connection is working you can ping the brick <span class="code">ping -c3 10.0.1.1</span>.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3><a name="step-5">Step 5: install <span class="name">lejos-server</span> onto the EV3</a></h3>

    <p>
        Download <span class="name">lejos-server</span> from
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5vv2ewPn7pGMHBzMm9DWk9EaVk/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. It should
        be a file called <span class="code">LocalServer.jar</span>.<br/>
        You may copy this file to the brick via scp or straight into the memory card.<br/><br/>
        <b>Via SCP on Linux</b><br/>
        <span class="code">scp LocalServer.jar root@10.0.1.1:/home/lejos/programs/</span><br/>
        Default password on the brick is empty, so when prompted just hit ENTER.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Via SCP on Windows</b><br/>
        You will need some client, like <a href="https://winscp.net/eng/index.php">WinSCP</a>.
        <br/>
        Open WinSCP, enter details:<br/>
        <img src="windows_screenshots/4.png"/><br/>
        You will be prompted for password:<br/>
        <img src="windows_screenshots/5.png"/><br/>
        Default password on the brick is empty, so simply click OK.<br/>
        You may see this error, but it should be harmless:<br/>
        <img src="windows_screenshots/6.png"/><br/>
        When you are logged in, navigate to <span class="code">/home/lejos/programs</span> on the brick and copy
        <span class="code">LocalServer.jar</span> there. If you are using WinSCP in commander mode it should look like
        this:<br/>
        <img src="windows_screenshots/7.png"/>
        <br/><br/>
        And you can simply drag and drop the file.<br/><br/>
        <b>Into the memory card</b><br/>
        Just connect your card to computer and place the file into <span class="code">/home/lejos/programs/</span> on
        the card (there will be two partitions on this card, so the file should be placed in the one where that folder
        exists).
    </p>

    <p>
        Now you can run <span class="name">lejos-server</span> on your brick (navigate to programs and execute
        <span class="code">LocalServer.jar</span>. When the program loads it should display text "READY" on the screen.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="step-6">Step 6: install Matlab toolbox <span class="name">matlab-puppeteer</span></a></h3>

    <p>
        In principle you don't have to use this toolbox or even Matlab. <span class="name">matlab-puppeteer</span> sends
        JSON commands to <span class="name">lejos-server</span> via TCP connection, so as long as you can do that in
        your programming language, you should be able to use it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Download the toolbox from
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5vv2ewPn7pGcTJIaG0zQ09OT0E/view?usp=sharing">here</a> (file
        <span class="code">matlab-puppeteer.mltbx</span>). Open the file with Matlab, and install when prompted.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="step-7">Step 7: Using <span class="name">matlab-puppeteer</span></a></h3>

    <p>
        Documentation is available on
        <a href="https://github.com/crunchiness/matlab-puppeteer">github</a> (README).
        Test programs are <a href="https://github.com/crunchiness/matlab-puppeteer/tree/master/test_programs">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="additional-1">Additional 1: building <span class="name">lejos-server</span> from source</a></h3>

    <p>
        If you want to build <span class="name">lejos-server</span> from source, you will need to do this via Eclipse
        using Eclipse plugin (or write your own build scripts, in which case this would be the place to start:
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Using%20ant%20build%20files/">http://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Using%20ant%20build%20files/</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="code">export EV3_HOME=~/leJOS_EV3_0.9.0-beta/lib/ev3</span>
        [how to install Eclipse plugin, set EV3_HOME].
